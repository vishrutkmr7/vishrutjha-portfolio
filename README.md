## Technologies Used

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): A React framework for production - it makes building fullstack React apps and sites a breeze and ships with built-in SSR.
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/): A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), the best place to deploy any frontend app. You can check out the live website [here](https://vishrutjha.com).
